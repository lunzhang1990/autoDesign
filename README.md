# autoDesign

1. conjugate method section in tutorial.ipynb section show how to find all LU equilibrium index of parameter regions. All codes are in stableStatistics.py and total2partial.py.

2. DSGRNtest is in KUIAS generated to compare conuting and conjugate method, not useful here but keep for later development.

3. The AutoDesign.ipynb is for future development if there is a robustness concern.
